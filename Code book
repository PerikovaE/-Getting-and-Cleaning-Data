There are TidyData.txt:
The first row is the header containing the names for each column.
180 groups (30 subjects and 6 activities)
71 columns â€“ 33 Mean variables + 33 Standard deviation variables + 1 subject( 1 of of the 30 test subjects) + activityName + activityNum + activityName.x + activityName.y

Forms activities:
1 - WALKING
2 - WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 - SITTING
5 - STANDING
6 - LAYING

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.
